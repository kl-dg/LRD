# Library Rat's Diary

Library Rat's Diary is a program for cataloging your reading history and display statitics and graphs about your book library. 

LRD is meant to replace spreadsheet control for readers who prefer these over an online service like Goodreads or LibraryThing. LRD accepts every user's whims - all fields are optional, even Title.

### Running from source code

Windows:

1. Download LRD by clicking on _Code_ > _Download ZIP_ near the top of this page and extract the ZIP.
2. Download Python 3.7 or better from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and install it.
3. Open command prompt or PowerShell and type _pip install pyqt5_ to add PyQt5 to Python.
4. Still on command prompt or Powershell, type _pip install matplotlib_ to add matplotlib to Python.
5. Double-click _start_lrd.pyw_.
