# Library Rat's Diary

Library Rat's Diary is a program for cataloging your reading history and display statistics and graphs about your book library. 

LRD is meant to replace spreadsheet control for readers who prefer these over an online service like Goodreads or LibraryThing. LRD accepts every user's whims - all fields are optional, even Title.
