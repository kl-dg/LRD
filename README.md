# Library Rat's Diary

Library Rat's Diary is a program for cataloging your reading history and display statistics and graphs about your book library. 

LRD is meant to replace spreadsheet control for readers who prefer these over an online service like Goodreads or LibraryThing. LRD accepts every user's whims - all fields are optional, even Title.

### Ideas and Future

All the initial aims were reached by now. Besides an eventual bugfix, improvements in interface aesthetics and organization can be made, as well as adding more importing options and graphs. This was my very first (usable) application, so things are likely to slow down here while I move on to other projects.
